Each team has 5 spirits. By the end of the teambuilding phase, every slot should be filled. If a slot is empty, you can simply click on it to select a spirit, but if a spirit is already assigned to it, you can either view the summary in order to open the summary pane, or press the change button to select a different spirit to put in that slot

[ul]
The spirit pane :
[/ul]

A list of every spirit available in the game. Will always appear on the right side, and allows you to select a spirit for whatever reason you summoned the pane for.

The summary pane :

The action pane :

A list of every action available for that action slot. Will always appear on the right side, and allows you to select an action for the selected action slot.
