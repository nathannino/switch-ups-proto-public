When defending, the total damage is divided by half.

[font_size=25][color=red]Warning :[/color][/font_size]
Defending counts as an action. It has +99 priority, costs 0 stamina and is at the same position for every spirit, but it is an action regardless.
As such, you cannot defend and do another action in the same turn.
In fact, it is the action at the position -1. It is also the action that will be used if a spirit attempts to use an action in the extra slot without having another spirit equipped
