# Simple, json-based tcp server wrapper
This isn't an actual project tbh, but this directory includes the nodes and scripts abstracting the tcp server
This also includes a basic example in the form of a chat application

...
Which is to say I don't actually want to remove the chat application, so I'm gonna act as if it was a full on project instead of a proof of concept
