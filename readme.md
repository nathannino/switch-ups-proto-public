# Switch-Ups  
#### A monster collector (well, the battle part of a monster collector) battle simulator inspired by a battle system introduced in the fifth generation of a certain serie  

## Project info :  
This project was made as part of a school assignement  
This project was made using the Godot engine (Specifically 4.4.stable)  
Finally, this project is still a mess, but not as much as the last one  

## Modifying :
While the license does allow you to modify it how you want, I do ask that, if you make a build, to change the `version` constant in `globals/game_info.gd`, to help lower the chances of compatibility issues

## Licensing :  
Except when otherwise specified in a subdirectory's **readme** or **license** file, everything here is licensed under the **MIT license**

## Future updates :
None planned. This was a school project, and the school assignement is done.  
However, unlike the last project, I will not archive this repository. I might come back to this project, and even if I don't, I will keep the concept in mind, in case there might ever be a day where I can find a way to execute it as a full game (and maybe make it more original)
