[center][font_size=27]Priority[/font_size][/center]

Every action has a priority attached to it. An action with a higher priority will give it an earlier place in the turn order than an action with a lower priority.

If an action does not indicate it's priority, it has a priority of 0

[font_size=25]Note : [/font_size]
The turn order is calculated at the start of a turn, and is not calculated again for the rest of the turn.

Internally, each priority level adds 1000 speed.
A dedicated player might be able to outspeed a priority level with enough dedication... if the oponent isn't attacking them.
