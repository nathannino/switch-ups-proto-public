Everything here uses either CC0 or an OGA license.
The "audio" folder contains the actual audio files
The "database" folder contains the metadata used by the game, including credits and licenses

Both files should share the same name (unless I forget). BGMs with intros and loops will have the _intro and _loop suffix in the audio folder, but be combined in the database folder
As such, find attributions inside of the .tres files included in the database folder

The license field is an enum, so it will be saved with a number instead of a String
0 -> CC0
1 -> OGA-BY 3.0
2 -> OGA-BY 4.0
License text is available next to this file (CC0.txt, OGA-BY-3.0.txt, OGA-BY-4.0.txt)

Or you can just open the game and look at the credits available in the main menu
